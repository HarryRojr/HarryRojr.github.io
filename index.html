  <h1>HarryRojr</h1>

  <h2>About me:</h2>
  <p>
    I'm HarryRojr, the guy who's got more gamertags than a Minecraft villager has trades! I'm everywhere—Xbox, PlayStation, EA, Ubisoft, Roblox, you name it. My life’s a 24/7 LAN party, minus the stale pizza (I prefer snacks with flavor). I'm sniping in Call of Duty, sailing the seas and stealing the Chests of Fortune, and parkouring through Assassin’s Creed like it’s my day job. Whether it’s clutch moments in Battlefield or trolling in Among Us, I’m the MVP you didn’t see coming and Currently, I’m serving up L’s in Sea of Thieves and making people ragequit in TEKKEN 8.
  </p>

  <h2>Videos & Anime Obsession:</h2>
  <p>
    When I’m not mashing buttons, I’m glued to YouTube or Crunchyroll, soaking in videos and anime like a sponge in a pixelated ocean. My watch history? A wild mix of Let’s Play videos, speedrunning fails, and anime so epic it makes my controller cry. I’ve binged Attack on Titan faster than you can say “Titan yeet,” and don’t get me started on Jujutsu Kaisen—I’m basically Gojo’s hype man. Whether it’s a 3-hour Elden Ring lore video or AMV edits of Naruto set to EDM, I’m here for it. Peep my faves below and join my anime marathon (popcorn not included)!
  </p>

  <h2>Music Is My Mana:</h2>
  <p>
    If I’m not gaming or watching anime, I’ve got tunes blasting louder than a Fortnite rocket launch. Music’s my mana, keeping me powered up through 3 a.m. gaming sessions and anime marathons. My playlist? A chaotic mix of Hyped up Bass drops for clutch moments, lo-fi beats for rainy nights, and anime OSTs that hit right in the feels. From Ed Sheeran to Sia, I’m vibing harder than a creeper at a rave. Always listening to music on Spotify!
  </p>

  <h2>Connect with me:</h2>
  <p>
    Wanna squad up, talk anime or movies, or roast my playlist? I’m everywhere, like a glitch in the Matrix. Hit me up on Xbox, PlayStation, Twitter(X) or Reddit, but don’t expect me to go easy on you in-game—I’m as ruthless as a Dark Souls invader.
